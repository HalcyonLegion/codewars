def solution(text, ending):
    # Needs something that takes the input (above, done) then checks the ending characters to check if they are matching the original string
    # essentially something like, if ending in text then true.This kind of worked but there's actually a method in Python called .endswith, crazy..
    
    return text.endswith(ending)
